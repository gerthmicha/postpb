This analysis will give you an overview of the unique topologies found in your posterior sample. Looking at these is useful to determine alternative the support for alternative hypothesis. By default, this analysis looks only at **100 randomly sampled trees** from the posterior sample. This will find the most commonly encountered topologies and give you a good idea of their frequencies. You can also opt to investigate the entire posterior tree samples by removing the tick in the checkbox. Note that in this case, the analysis may run for a long time (depending on the number of trees, the number of distinct topologies, and the number of taxa in your dataset). A progress bar will help to estimate the remaining time.
